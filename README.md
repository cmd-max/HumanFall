Introduction
The purpose of this project is to showcase the implementation of a fall detection algorithm using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Fall detection systems are commonly used in various scenarios, such as assisted living facilities and wearable devices, to monitor and react to potential falls by individuals.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle Dataset Source. It contains a collection of sensor data including accelerometers and gyroscopes, recorded during different activities including falls. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features and label instances as fall or non-fall.

Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and robust model. It is well-suited for classification tasks, such as fall detection, as it can handle complex relationships in the data and mitigate overfitting.

In this notebook, the following steps are covered:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loading the dataset, exploring its structure, and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as feature extraction and data splitting.

Model Creation: Building a Random Forest classifier using a machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn). Tuning hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

Model Training: Training the Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
